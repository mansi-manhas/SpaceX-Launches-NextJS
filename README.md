## What it contains

I created a basic next.js beginners app using "create-next-app"

- Added Apollo GraphQL Client
- using "getStaticProps" lifecyle method to fetch data
- Fetched data with a graphQL query using ApolloClient
- Adding spaceX launch data on the UI
- SpaceX API endpoint: https://api.spacex.land/graphql/

## How to run the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
